Hello, 

I am a development engineer morphed into a sales professional. This site shows examples of my scripting alter-ego aiming to make my life easier and my job more productive via scripting tools. 

I have created Shell, Perl, Tcl, and as of late, Python scripts throughout my professional career (> 60 scripts and counting). I am now a practitioner in a perpetual learning mode of data analysis and machine learning, as time permits. 

Thanks for stopping by!

Marlon
